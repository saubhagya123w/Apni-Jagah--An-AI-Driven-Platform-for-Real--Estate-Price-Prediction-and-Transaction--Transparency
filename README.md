Transforming property deals with AI, Smart Predictions, and Verified Security

🚀 Overview
Apni Jagah is an AI-powered real estate platform that tackles the long-standing issues in property transactions — price ambiguity, fraud, and inefficient manual processes. Our system integrates predictive analytics, smart deal evaluations, and document verification to deliver secure, personalized, and data-driven property experiences.

🔍 Key Features
💰 AI-Based Price Prediction
Uses machine learning (Random Forest) for accurate, location-aware price estimates.

🔒 Smart Deal Prediction
Suggests optimal prices balancing buyer intent and market conditions.

📄 Document Verification Workflow
Validates seller-uploaded property documents via legal teams.

🤝 Buyer Navigation & Comparison Tool
Helps buyers compare multiple listings with intent-based filters and recommendations.

🌐 Neighborhood Trend Insights
Gain data-backed local area insights before investing.

📊 Performance Metrics
Achieved R² = 0.85 with Random Forest for high prediction accuracy.

🧠 Tech Stack
Backend: Python, Flask/Django

Frontend: React

🧠 Machine Learning Libraries Used in Apni Jagah
📌 1. Pandas
For data manipulation and analysis.

Used in location filtering, neighborhood similarity, and CSV-based operations.

📌 2. NumPy
For numerical computations and array handling, especially in prediction pipelines.

📌 3. Scikit-learn (sklearn)
Used across all ML features:

House Price Prediction Model
→ Model training (LinearRegression, RandomForestRegressor, etc.)
→ Preprocessing (OneHotEncoder, StandardScaler, Pipeline)
→ Model evaluation (train_test_split, mean_squared_error, etc.)

Neighborhood Price Prediction
→ Used for finding similar property patterns based on features like BHK, sqft, and location.

📌 4. Joblib
For saving and loading ML models (model.pkl) and preprocessing pipelines (pipeline.pkl).

📌 5. Matplotlib / Seaborn (if used during initial EDA)
Optional: for data visualization during model development (can include in GitHub if used).

📈 Datasets
Key features used for prediction:
Location
Area (sq ft)
BHK (configuration)
Price (target variable)
🔬 Machine Learning Evaluation
Model	MAE (INR)	R² Score
Logistic Regression	4,833,250.00	0.15
Decision Tree	1,848,901.61	0.78
Random Forest	1,692,424.65	0.85
✅ Random Forest outperformed due to its ensemble learning capability and reduced overfitting.
